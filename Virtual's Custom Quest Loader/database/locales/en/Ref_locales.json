And it's going to be you. By consent, of course. We don't practice cruelty here, ha! I can help you reach heights and riches beyond your wildest dreams. You just have to take me up on my offer. But, you know, actions always trump words. So enter the Arena and win. That's how I will know you're ready to push forward.",

Let's start with the basics. The Arena's in Tarkov, but the biggest sponsors are overseas. They watch every game, place bets, throw money at the favorites. And you need to get some of those big shots interested. Get their attention, show them you're worthy. Make a name for yourself. One win alone isn't enough to do it. Show them you can make a thrilling performance!",

You'll make tons of cash, and you'll be famous. Bring the money, I'll organize everything. Just be warned: if you lose five times, you start again.",

I hope you've already picked out a little apartment in Tarkov's elite neighborhood, because you'll have it soon with all this money! Kidding. All the houses in those neighborhoods are soon gonna collapse anyway. Anyway, some very powerful people from across the border are interested in you. Powerful and wealthy. I can't tell you their names, it's a business secret, and I'm not violating what I signed. So, these people are ready to take you under their wing and sponsor you heavily, but first they want guarantees. You need to become the champion. Fly high, soar above the rest. You're gonna have to spend more time in the Arena. I can see it in your eyes that you're ready.",
