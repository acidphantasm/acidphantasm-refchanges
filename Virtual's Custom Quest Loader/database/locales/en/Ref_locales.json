And it's going to be you. By consent, of course. We don't practice cruelty here, ha! I can help you reach heights and riches beyond your wildest dreams. You just have to take me up on my offer. But, you know, actions always trump words. So enter the Arena and win. That's how I will know you're ready to push forward.",

    "668caeedbdb70c05d702f112 description": "You're under my wing from now on, brother. I'll make sure you get progress good, but you're gonna have to get your ass in gear more often. Let's start with the basics. The Arena's in Tarkov, but the biggest sponsors are overseas. They watch every game, place bets, throw money at the favorites. And you need to get some of those big shots interested. Get their attention, show them you're worthy. Make a name for yourself. One win alone isn't enough to do it. Show them you can make a thrilling performance!",
    "668caeedbdb70c05d702f112 successMessagetext": "I see the progress you're making! They're starting to talk about you overseas. People are interested. It's a sign that you're doing the right thing!",

Become the one they talk about, the one they come to see. Then the cash will come, and then other goodies: cars, girls... Although Tarkov is a little short on the latter. Anyway, the Arena is a great career opportunity right now, ha!",
    "668caeedbdb70c05d702f14c successMessagetext": "And now you're one step closer to the big leagues! Respect, brother.",

The odds are still stacked against you, so don't let the audience down! Speaking of that. You got some money? You gotta bet on yourself and then win six times. You'll make tons of cash, and you'll be famous. Bring the money, I'll organize everything. Just be warned: if you lose five times, you start again.",

I hope you've already picked out a little apartment in Tarkov's elite neighborhood, because you'll have it soon with all this money! Kidding. All the houses in those neighborhoods are soon gonna collapse anyway. Anyway, some very powerful people from across the border are interested in you. Powerful and wealthy. I can't tell you their names, it's a business secret, and I'm not violating what I signed. So, these people are ready to take you under their wing and sponsor you heavily, but first they want guarantees. You need to become the champion. Fly high, soar above the rest. You're gonna have to spend more time in the Arena. I can see it in your eyes that you're ready.",

He was Ref's previous champion for a while and then all of a sudden he disappeared. And I know for sure this had nothing to do with Kaban and Kollontay. If you don't want to vanish the same way this guy did, look for the last champion's apartment. I believe there's something of interest left there. The champion used to hang out with the smugglers in Dorms on Customs. Maybe you'll find some clues on how to get into the apartment.",

The champion, as far as I know, kept a journal. Yeah, like some teenager, but that's actually working in your favor. Why don't you go over there again and take a closer look? There's got to be more information in the journal about Ref, some dirt on him. Do that if you want to stop being expendable in the Arena. And one more thing: if you bring me any info on Ref that'll be worthy of my time, I'll pay you well.",
